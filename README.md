Perspective Transform
======

Practice assignment 3 for CAP 4720.

The assignment document was as follows:
- Use lookAt and perspective transformation to render the supplied objects.
- The supplied objects are each composed of an array of triangle meshes. Each mesh is defined by an array of vertex positions, optionally additional arrays containing other vertex attributes such as colors, normals, etc.. and optionally an array of indices defining the triangles of the mesh. In the absence of the index array, assume that three consecutive vertices in the vertex list define a triangle.
- Use lookAt and perspective functions defined in cuon-matrix.js (or any similar Math library).
- Set the default parameters for these two functions.
